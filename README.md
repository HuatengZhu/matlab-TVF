This repository contains the Matlab implementations of numerical schemes for the regularised total variation flow.
Matlab implementation of schemes for the regularised total variation flow.

The schemes presented here are analysed in the article Numerical analysis for the regularised total variation flow. Jérôme Droniou, Kim-Ngan Le, and Huateng Zhu. 27p, 2025. Url:http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13929.

If you use these codes in a publication, please mention this article.

Note: Other meshes that can be used to run these matlab codes are available in the HHO-Lapl-OM repository, see https://github.com/jdroniou/HHO-Lapl-OM.
